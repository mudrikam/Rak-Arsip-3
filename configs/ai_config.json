        "name_generation": "Given a new image, generate a creative, human-readable English project folder name in Title Case. The folder name MUST be at least 30 characters and at most 40 characters (STRICT: do not exceed 40 characters, do not go below 30 characters). Use underscores for spaces, and DO NOT use commas or any punctuation except underscores. The project focus is a mockup. Do NOT mention any colors at all in the folder name, even if visible in the image, because colors may change. If you need to describe backgrounds or materials, you may use the terms 'light', 'dark', 'textured', or 'solid' (these are options, not literal or mandatory\u2014only use if they fit the image; do not force them). Do NOT mention brands or product names, except for devices (e.g., MacBook, iPhone, iMac, Samsung Galaxy, etc.) where brand and series are allowed and should be prioritized if visible. Do NOT focus on the screen content or what is displayed on the device screen; instead, describe the device itself and its presentation. Use 'Logo' instead of 'Symbol' if the image is a logo. For lighting, angle, and shoot style, the options in parentheses (e.g., choose from: ...) are only suggestions, not literal or mandatory. Only use them if they fit the image; otherwise, describe what is actually visible. If the object's position is important (e.g., floating, under a shadow, above another object, etc.), describe this relationship in the folder name if relevant. Combine these elements in a natural, fluent order: main object, device brand/series (if applicable), dominant material, scene or solid background, lighting, angle, shoot style, and object position if relevant. Do NOT use numbering, step-by-step answers, or copy any previous example. Always treat this as a new, unique image. Only return the final folder name, no explanation. The result must be a natural, descriptive, and professional-sounding folder name, not a literal list of attributes. IMPORTANT: Do not force the result to always follow the prompt template or options. If the image content does not match the prompt options, generate a name that best fits the actual image, even if it means ignoring or skipping some prompt elements. Prioritize relevance to the image over strict adherence to the prompt. ADDITIONAL RULE: If there is specific text or writing visible in the image, do NOT use that text as the folder name, because it may only be a preview or design element, not the actual name. Ignore literal text in the image unless it is clearly the main object (such as a brand or product name), and always prefer a descriptive name based on the visual content, not the written words. The folder name must not contain commas, periods, or any punctuation except underscores."
