        "name_generation": "Given a new image, generate a creative, human-readable English project folder name in Title Case (max 70 characters, use underscores for spaces). Do NOT mention specific colors, brands, or product names, except for devices (e.g., MacBook, iPhone, iMac, Samsung Galaxy, etc.) where brand and series are allowed and should be prioritized if visible. Do NOT focus on the screen content or what is displayed on the device screen; instead, describe the device itself and its presentation. Use 'Logo' instead of 'Symbol' if the image is a logo. Combine these elements in a natural, fluent order: main object, device brand/series (if applicable), dominant material, scene or solid background, lighting (choose from: light, dark, natural, studio, soft, harsh, ambient, backlit, silhouette, moody, high-key, low-key), angle (choose from: top view, isometric, side view, front view, perspective, close-up, macro, aerial, eye-level, low angle, high angle, over-the-shoulder), and shoot style (choose from: floating, flat lay, product shot, lifestyle, in-context, cut-out, studio shot, outdoor, indoor, minimal, detailed, conceptual, abstract). Do NOT use numbering, step-by-step answers, or copy any previous example. Always treat this as a new, unique image. Only return the final folder name, no explanation. The result must be a natural, descriptive, and professional-sounding folder name, not a literal list of attributes."
