        "name_generation": "Given a new image, generate a creative, human-readable English project folder name in Title Case. The folder name MUST be at least 30 characters and at most 40 characters (STRICT: do not exceed 40 characters, do not go below 30 characters). Use underscores for spaces, and DO NOT use commas or any punctuation except underscores. The project focus is a mockup. Do NOT mention any colors at all in the folder name, even if visible in the image, because colors may change. If you need to describe backgrounds or materials, you may use the terms 'light', 'dark', 'textured', or 'solid' (these are options, not literal or mandatory\u2014only use if they fit the image; do not force them). Do NOT mention brands or product names, except for devices (e.g., MacBook, iPhone, iMac, Samsung Galaxy, etc.) where brand and series are allowed and should be prioritized if visible. Do NOT focus on the screen content or what is displayed on the device screen; instead, describe the device itself and its presentation. Use 'Logo' instead of 'Symbol' if the image is a logo. For lighting, angle, and shoot style, the options in parentheses (e.g., choose from: ...) are only suggestions, not literal or mandatory. Only use them if they fit the image; otherwise, describe what is actually visible. If the object's position is important (e.g., floating, under a shadow, above another object, etc.), describe this relationship in the folder name if relevant. Combine these elements in a natural, fluent order: main object, device brand/series (if applicable), dominant material, scene or solid background, lighting, angle, shoot style, and object position if relevant. Do NOT use numbering, step-by-step answers, or copy any previous example. Always treat this as a new, unique image. Only return the final folder name, no explanation. The result must be a natural, descriptive, and professional-sounding folder name, not a literal list of attributes. IMPORTANT: Do not force the result to always follow the prompt template or options. If the image content does not match the prompt options, generate a name that best fits the actual image, even if it means ignoring or skipping some prompt elements. Prioritize relevance to the image over strict adherence to the prompt. ADDITIONAL RULE: If there is specific text or writing visible in the image, do NOT use that text as the folder name, because it may only be a preview or design element, not the actual name. Ignore literal text in the image unless it is clearly the main object (such as a brand or product name), and always prefer a descriptive name based on the visual content, not the written words. The folder name must not contain commas, periods, or any punctuation except underscores.",
        "invoice_analysis": "Analyze this invoice/receipt image and extract transaction information. Return EXACTLY one valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE (no markdown, no code fences, no commentary, no extra text). The JSON MUST be a compact single-line JSON (no newline characters) and must follow this exact structure: {\"transaction_details\": {\"name\": \"descriptive transaction name in Indonesian style\", \"type\": \"income/expense/transfer or empty string\", \"transaction_date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM or empty string\", \"pocket_id\": null, \"destination_pocket_id\": null, \"card_id\": null, \"currency_id\": null, \"location_id\": null, \"category_id\": null, \"status_id\": null, \"tags\": \"comma separated tags or empty string\", \"note\": \"additional notes or empty string\"}, \"items\": [{\"item_type\": \"select items type or empty string\", \"sku\": \"sku or empty string\", \"item_name\": \"item name\", \"item_description\": \"description or empty string\", \"quantity\": 1, \"unit\": \"pcs/kg/etc or empty string\", \"amount\": 0.0, \"width\": 0.0, \"height\": 0.0, \"depth\": 0.0, \"weight\": 0.0, \"material\": \"material or empty string\", \"color\": \"color or empty string\", \"file_url\": \"url or empty string\", \"license_key\": \"key or empty string\", \"expiry_date\": \"date or empty string\", \"digital_type\": \"type or empty string\", \"note\": \"note or empty string\"}]}. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Output MUST be a single JSON object (one open brace at start, one closing brace at end). Do NOT stream multiple JSON fragments, do NOT print more than one JSON object, and DO NOT split the items array into separate JSON objects. 2) Produce compact single-line JSON (no \\n characters) to avoid accidental splits during streaming. 3) For 'name': extract merchant/store/platform identity OR location/street/address information if visible; create a descriptive name in Indonesian style (examples: 'Belanja di Indomaret Jl. Sudirman', 'Pembelian Tokopedia', 'Makan di Grab Food - Restoran ABC' etc. 4) For 'transaction_date': extract date/time if visible in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. If not visible, use empty string. 5) For each item: 'amount' is UNIT PRICE (not line total). If invoice shows '3 pcs x Rp 10.000.0 = Rp 30.000.0', then quantity=3 and amount=10000.0. When representing monetary values, ALWAYS include a decimal with one digit '.0' for whole-number amounts (for example, 10000.0). 6) VALIDATION IS MANDATORY AND SENSITIVE: sum(quantity × amount) across items MUST match exactly the final total on the invoice. If the result is less or more than the invoice total, add a new item named 'Rounding' with the required amount so the total matches the invoice exactly. 7) Include separate items for taxes, shipping, fees if present. 8) For 'tags': produce 2-5 relevant tags separated by commas. 9) For 'note': include additional relevant data (payment method, cashier, order number, promo codes, delivery notes, warranty, etc.) if visible. 10) Use exact ID values when available; otherwise use null or empty string/0 as appropriate. 11) If uncertain about a value, prefer empty string or 0 rather than emitting partial JSON fragments. 12) STRICT: Do not output anything other than the single-line JSON object. The assistant must not add any explanation, debug prints, or extra characters before or after the JSON. Ensure final JSON is syntactically valid. 13) For 'type': ONLY select 'income' if the invoice clearly shows a receipt of adding money (e.g., top-up, bank receipt). ONLY select 'expense' if the invoice clearly shows a payment or expenditure (e.g., shopping, bill payment, food order). For bank receipts/struk bank, ALWAYS assume we are the recipient, so it is always an invoice and type must be 'income'. NEVER select 'transfer'."
